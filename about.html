      Hi! Right now, you're in my 'About' page. <br>
      Anyway, I'm CreativeMouse, a game developer, and an occasional writer.
      I have been a game developer since approximately 1 year, with my first game being Burgers and the reds.
      I've joined 6 game jams, with 'notable' success in the lastest jam I joined.
      I mostly join my game jams solo, but if you'd like for me to join your team, I'd be happy to join as the developer (or, programmer. please note I'm not good at drawing or composing, although I'm learning.)
      I use <a href="https://gdevelop.io">GDEVELOP</a> as my main engine, and I have plans to learn godot. Although until now, I feel much more comfortable using GDevelop.
      My most notable successes are:
      <br>
      <br>
      -6th place out of 29 games (5th according to the jury) in the<a href="https://itch.io/jam/soft-jam/rate/2418738"> Soft Jam</a>, with 4th place in both Sound Design and Art.
      <br>
      -9th place in <a href="https://itch.io/jam/img27/rate/2060498">IMGJ 27</a> out of 23 games, with 5th place in both the fun and UI categories.
      <br>
      -16th place in <a href="https://itch.io/jam/clicker-jam-spring-2023/rate/2009878">Clicker Jam Spring</a> out of 75 games, with 9th in the Theme category.
